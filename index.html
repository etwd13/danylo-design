    <h1>Hey, Iâ€™m Danylo a product designer currently woking at Temper. </h1>
    <p>I started making ads and websites for companies in my hometown. Now, after a decade of working with a bunch of
        companies and a lot of talented people I've developed my own set of problem-solving patterns that I'm happy to
        apply and refine while designing digital products. </p>
    ,<p>I'm more of a generalist than a specialist. I enjoy learning about anthropology, coding or storytelling more
        than about the latest UI patterns. I like to self-improve, learn the skills of neighboring professions to better
        understand the whole the possibilities.
