    <h1>Hey, Iâ€™m Danylo a product designer currently woking at Temper. </h1>
    <p>I started making ads and websites for companies in my hometown. Now, after a decade of working with a bunch of
        companies and a lot of talented people I've developed my own set of problem-solving patterns that I'm happy to
        apply and refine while designing digital products. </p>

    <p>I love patterns. I can't help but find them in products, problems, trends, people's behaviors and pretty much
        anything that spend some time thinking about. I love taking on complex >problems, dissect them, empathize and
        come up with possible solutions. I also like the process of building these ideas out, getting feedback and
        improving them. </p>

    <p>I'm more of a generalist than a specialist. I enjoy learning about anthropology, coding or storytelling more than
        about the latest UI patterns. I like to self-improve, learn the skills of neighboring professions to better
        understand the whole the possibilities. </p>
    </p>

    <p>I value good company culture and a caring, ambitious team. I enjoy a productive work process with the freedom to
        explore
        ideas. I love it when people with different goals and perspectives work together to build something useful for
        others.</p>
